First Slide
========================================================

Introduction

- This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

- The app developed and the entire presentation is located in Github Repository:
https://github.com/10691deepak/Developing-Data-Products

Second Slide
========================================================

This app help us optimize the best car for our use by looking at the mtcars dataset

- This app takes in different features you would like to be in the car, and then it uses the
pricing feature to optimize the best car for your trip distance and gasoline price.

- Bottom line is, the more information you provide, the app will give you the best deal of the car 
available at your location.

Motor Car Data Sets
========================================================

The below data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance automobiles (1973â€“74 models). Following is a brief summary


```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

Plot
========================================================

By exlporing below, we can see a relaitonship between; miles per gallon(mpg), displacement(disp) and weight(wt)


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(car)
scatterplot.matrix(~mpg+disp+wt, data = mtcars, cex.axis = 2)

```
